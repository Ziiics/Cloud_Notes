Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Logically isolated private cloud inside the whole AWS infrastructure
- AWS account comes with default VPC based on AWS region
- Can manually configure virtual network environement with IP address range, subnets, and gateway
- Support IPv4 and IPv6, by default IPv4
- All different subnet have to stay on one region, but couple VPN can be create throughout different region
- Allow NACLs (Network Access Control Lists - firewall) and add multiple layer of advanced security features
- Can also store S3 inside so that only instances inside VPN are able to access it

Amazon VPC concept
- When creating VPC, private IP address has to be assigned using CIDR block
- Private IP address inside VPC wil not be reachable through the public, and are only used for private communication of your instances inside the VPC
- Route can be local and not, each subnet has to ahve a route table

Amazon VPC security
- NACL is basically the firewall
- There are default option and can be customized, by default wil denies all inbound and allow all outbound
- Each subnet can only has one NACL
- List will be checked from the top to bottom
- Security group are stateful
- Different tier include web tier, application tier, and data tier

Enabling VPC Internet Connection
- Attach internet gateway to VPC
- Add subnet route to the table and add route to internet gateway
- Add IPv4, IPv6 or elastic IP address (static IPv4 address)
- To enable instances in a private subnet to able to reach out but for teh outside to not able to reach the instances, use NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway
- Add NAT gateway to the route to direct traffic form internet to NAT gateway (doesn't support IPv6)
- For IPv6, use Egress-only Internet gateway, allow traffic to go out but prevent inbound traffic
  - Make sure to add it to the route table for IPv6 to go to Egress-only
