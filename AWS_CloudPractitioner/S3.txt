S3 (Simple Storage Service) Overview
- An object storage service that kept data as object
- Object consist of data and metadata (name-value pairs) itself
- Object is kept in S3 bucket and uniquely identified using key
- It is scalable and pay only for used services
- Data durability is eleven 9’s
- Has encryption features and access management tools
- Can have public access and can block it too
- Compliance to PCI-DSS, FedRAMP, HIPAA, EU Data Protection
- Auditing capabilities
- Host static website
- Can be used for website, mobile/enterprise app, backup, IoT devices, big data analytics

Amazon S3 More Features
- Had wide range of data storage (bucket) accessibility from data that is often access all the way to archives that are accessed every couple days or weeks, from S3 Standard to Glacier
- Management tools for granular data control
  - S3 Storage Class Analysis: Sort data based on data access patern
  - S3 Lifecycle Policy: transfer data to different bucket based on how often it is access, and also adjust when data expire
  - S3 Cross-Region Replication (CPR) or S3 Same Region Replication: data can be replicated to AWS at different region or in the same region
  - S3 Object Lock: lock daat based on retention period, enforce write-once-read-many (WORM) policies
- Works with AWS Lambda, which can be used to create alert, log activities, automate workflow
- Can run big-data analytics on the S3 objects itself
- Data can be queried with,
  - Amazon Athena: with SQL, query regular data
  - Amazon Redshift Spectrum (mostly for complex queries): with SQL for data at rest
- Items stored can be versioned or unversined to easily retrieve the previous version, useful against accidental deletion or overwrite

Amazon S3 - Access Management
- By default, access are privete and only accessible to resource owner. But access can be granted by different option,
  - Resource-based policies: policies are added to resources. Temporary-access also allowed using time-limited URL
    - ACL (Access Control List) - added to the resources with the GUI on S3
    - Bucket Policices - addesd as JSON file to object in a bucket, or the bucket itself
  - User policies: Given to user, using AWS IAM
  - Combination of both
