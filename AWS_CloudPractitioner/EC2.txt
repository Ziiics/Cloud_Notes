AWS Global Infrastructure Overview
- AWS Regions: is a geographical cluster of data centers. Has at least 2 AZ, can has up to 6 AZ
- Availability Zones (AZ): Separated couple km away for redundancy, each AZ has 1-3 data centers
  - Housed in separate facilities with redundant power and reduntant parallel fiber network
  - Provde Amazon CloudFront that uses Global Content Delivery Network (CDN)
  - Helps with partitioning to pretect from natural disasters

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) Overview
- Enables scale up, handle changes or spickes
- Hosted in multiple region, SLA 99/99% availability for each Amazon EC2 region
- Can access Amazon EFS across AZs, VPC, and regions

EC2 Basics
- Instances: virtual server, used to control the amount of CPU, Memory, GPU, storage, and network capacity needed
- Differenct instances option
  - General purpose: CPU, memory, and network balances. Ex: Web server
  - Compute optimized: CPU utilization. Ex: Game
  - Memory optimized: used to keep large memory data sets. Ex: big data
  - Storage optimized: sequential read & write access. Ex: Data warehouse
  - Accelerated computing: Hardware accelerators where GPU is prioritized. Ex: Machine/Deep learning
  - HPC optimized: uses High-performance processors to fit different use cases. Ex: Complex simluation
- AMI (Amazon Machine Image): template that allows cutom configurations to create virtual servers EC2

AWS Global Infrastructure Benefit
- Better performance, availabilty and reliability
- Security that satisfy the requirements for military and global banks
- Scalability based on actually business need
- Lower cost of ownership nad overall price of IT Infrastructure

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- Is the location where EC2 instances are kept, each EBS are a single block level storage volumes
- One EBS can only mount to one instance at a time, multiple EBS can attach to one instance
- The latency between EBS volume and EC2 instance is milisecond digit which is very 
- Used for high throughput and intensive workloads
- Dsta persist in the EBS volume even when EC2 instance is deleted
- Two type storage used are: 
  - SSD (Solid-State Drive) backed storage - for frequent R/W with small I/O
  - HDD (Hard Disk Drive) backed storage - throughput intensive workload as mapReduce, Data warehouse, log processing
- 

DNS - query ip address from the hostname requested by user or PC.

AWS Support Overview
- Basic - free and automatic, for personal and developer
- Paid option - all the resources, including unlimited tech support

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - dedicated virtual network in AWS accound, the VPC must match the subnets in the AZ

AWS System Manager Overview helps manage AWS resources securely. It provide functions as,
- Operations Management - done from central location for issue recsolving and investigation
- Change Managemnet - systems manager document that automate common tasks
- Application Management - to manage the application and service metadata
- Node Management - AWS Systems Manager Fleet Management used to streamlines management

AWS System manager use cases:
- Centralized operations by aggregating data to viewable console
- Implement best proactive and reactive processes
- Remediate Security Issues - enhance security and the Compliance
- Auto-resolve Issues - managge application and issues easily
